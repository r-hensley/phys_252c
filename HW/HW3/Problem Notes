# 1

Central confidence interval
Integrate from 0 until you have 15%, then integrate from the right until you have 15%, and the remainder will be 68.27%
mu_i = b + s G_i  
-ln L = sum n_i ln(mu_i) - mu_i

P(s) = L(s) / int(100 to 1000) L(s') ds'

Look at lecture 13 slide 2: bayesian multisource spectra: recap with all the beta = 0




# 2

Window -> Use ideal bin window from HW 2
Take log to make it possible
Don't forget about efficiency 

Likelihood will be just some falling curve maxed at 0, integrate it out to 95% for the confidence interval
Don't worry about efficiency for part (b), integrate gaussian for each bin




# 3

Obs. k succ, n trials
P(k; n) = n! / k! (n-k)! epsilon^k (1-epsilon)^(n-k)

P(ep) = P(k;n) / int(0 to 1) P(k;n) d(ep)
Don't need priors because we just use uniform and it'll cancel
Just need to integrate the above

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
0 2 4 6 8 10
6: 6/dx
